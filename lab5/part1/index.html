      <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>
      <p><strong>By Evan Wild</strong></p>

      <section> <!-- 3. The 1st section of content about bears. -->
        <p>
          Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures,
          self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned
          documentary, <em>The Jungle Book</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? In this
          article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section> <!-- 4. The 2nd section of content about the different types of bears. -->
        <h3>Types of bear</h3>
        <p>
          Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear,
          then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home in
          urban areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourage different behaviour however, as
          you'll find out below. The table below also gives you some useful facts about bears.
        </p>

      <section> <!-- 7. The eating habits and and the habitats of the bears. -->
        <h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3>
        <p>
          Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing ingredients. In general they
          will hunt for food themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will track down their sustenance from
          farms or country houses. They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.
        </p> <!-- 8. Wild bear jpg image. -->
        <img src="media/wild-bear.jpg" alt="Wild bear standing in forest clearing">
        <p>
          Urban (gentrified) bears on the other hand have largely abandoned the old ways. They will hunt other urban
          creatures if necessary (including other predators like rats and foxes), but prefer to scavenge from readily
          available urban food outlets like dumpsters, bins, and fast food joints. When food has proven scarce, urban
          bears have even been known to break into people's kitchens and steal essentials like baked beans, ready meals,
          and microwave ovens.
        </p> <!-- 9. Urban bear jpg image. -->
        <img src="media/urban-bear.jpg" alt="Urban bear searching through trash in city street">
        <p>
          Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks, to the toilets in McDonald's, to their
          own apartment.

      <section> <!-- 10. The section about the bear's mating behaviour & rituals. -->
        <h3>Mating rituals</h3>
        <p>
          Bears are romantic creatures by nature, and will naturally look for a mate that they can spend the rest of
          their lives with. They will woo a potential suitor by making their dwelling look attractive — for example with
          cave paintings or a bed of reeds in the case of a wild bear, and mood lighting and a Michael Bublé CD in the
          case of an urban bear.

        <h3>About the author</h3>
        <p>
          Evan Wild is an unemployed plumber from Doncaster, who has been really "in to" wildlife since childhood. He
          once went to Chester Zoo on holiday, but got ill after eating a doner kebab.
        </p>
        <p>
          He has never seen a bear, but once read a Daily Mail article about them, and thinks they sound cool.

                Oh I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. With their sniffing
                little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace — I was thinking of putting them all in
                a truck and driving them outta here. I run a zoo, you know.
